                    Hi! I am a second-year student at ASU studying supply chain management. 

                    While I would still consider myself a novice, since I recently switched from pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science to a bachelor of science in supply chain management, I believe that the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that I have obtained will complement supply chain management wonderfully. 

                    Some notable experiences I have are project management in my Textbook Management System and Fine Motor Skill Game for Toddlers projects, where I managed and coordinated milestones and work division as well as being a developer for those projects.
